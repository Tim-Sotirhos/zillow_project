Zillow Project Information

Important:

1. Produce a model that is configured to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those whose last transaction was during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of May and June in 2017.

2. Provide the distribution of tax rates by county. Include the distribution of tax rates for each county inorder to see how much they vary within the properties in the county and the rates the bulk of the properties sit around.

3. For the first iteration of the Zestimate model, use only square feet of the home, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to estimate the properties assessed value. The result will be the mvp (minimally viable product).
