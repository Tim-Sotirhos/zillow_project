Brain dump on presentation.
talk about the process of the workflow
include a null hypothesis
provide closing thoughts
compare the baseline to R^2
provide some insight to the tax distribution

Zach review of presentations:
table with row highlighted
model by county
multiple visuals related to same target
use tableau
talk through the visualization explain what you see and take away
clear title, to the point bullet
interpret the statistics and explain the statistics
findings up first
tax rate by county simple eliminate noise
process slide x - y - z
correlation heat map is distracting
use bar chart to show variables to eliminate noise

IMPROVEMENTS:
what is distribution of tax rates by county? many didnt answer
conclusion slide
lead with findings
project goals restate then findings
label the axis and title of the visualization
transparency alpha to show clustering better on plot
intertpretation of numbers R^2 and RMSE in plain english
make sure your numbers have commas, percentages, and dollars
limit the data
talk through the visualization and what are the take aways
limitations of results from the data
data walkthrough the shape of the data
its okay to drop values that are caused by human errors
interdependence of independent variables
seperate variables by combining them with weights or new 
use discriptive language and explain the charts
